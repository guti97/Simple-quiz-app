This simple quiz app allows users to test their knowledge of the Royal Family. The app presents multiple-choice questions, and users can select their answers by clicking on the options. The app then provides immediate feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect (with tone). The quiz continues until all 30 questions are answered, and a final score is displayed at the end. The app is designed with a graphical interface using **Tkinter**, making it easy to navigate and interact with.
